/**
 * SECTION:soup-session
 * @short_description: Soup session state object
 *
 * #SoupSession is the object that controls client-side HTTP. A
 * #SoupSession encapsulates all of the state that libsoup is keeping
 * on behalf of your program; cached HTTP connections, authentication
 * information, etc.
 *
 * Most applications will only need a single #SoupSession; the primary
 * reason you might need multiple sessions is if you need to have
 * multiple independent authentication contexts. (Eg, you are
 * connecting to a server and authenticating as two different users at
 * different times; the easiest way to ensure that each #SoupMessage
 * is sent with the authentication information you intended is to use
 * one session for the first user, and a second session for the other
 * user.)
 *
 * #SoupSession itself is an abstract class, with two subclasses. If
 * you are using the glib main loop, you will generally want to use
 * #SoupSessionAsync, which uses non-blocking I/O and callbacks. On
 * the other hand, if your application is threaded and you want to do
 * synchronous I/O in a separate thread from the UI, use
 * #SoupSessionSync.

	 * Emitted when a request is queued on @session. (Note that
	 * "queued" doesn't just mean soup_session_queue_message();
	 * soup_session_send_message() implicitly queues the message
	 * as well.)
	 *
	 * When sending a request, first #SoupSession::request_queued
	 * is emitted, indicating that the session has become aware of
	 * the request.
	 *
	 * Once a connection is available to send the request on, the
	 * session emits #SoupSession::request_started. Then, various
	 * #SoupMessage signals are emitted as the message is
	 * processed. If the message is requeued, it will emit
	 * #SoupMessage::restarted, which will then be followed by
	 * another #SoupSession::request_started and another set of
	 * #SoupMessage signals when the message is re-sent.
	 *
	 * Eventually, the message will emit #SoupMessage::finished.
	 * Normally, this signals the completion of message
	 * processing. However, it is possible that the application
	 * will requeue the message from the "finished" handler (or
	 * equivalently, from the soup_session_queue_message()
	 * callback). In that case, the process will loop back to
	 * #SoupSession::request_started.
	 *
	 * Eventually, a message will reach "finished" and not be
	 * requeued. At that point, the session will emit
	 * #SoupSession::request_unqueued to indicate that it is done
	 * with the message.
	 *
	 * To sum up: #SoupSession::request_queued and
	 * #SoupSession::request_unqueued are guaranteed to be emitted
	 * exactly once, but #SoupSession::request_started and
	 * #SoupMessage::finished (and all of the other #SoupMessage
	 * signals) may be invoked multiple times for a given message.
